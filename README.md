# MyMarket
The project that is going to be submitted to Tech Challenge at kariyer.net

As of September 18, Wednesday, 17:47 (UTC+3) the project is finished. Tested on multiple devices to make sure that it works. Do remember that there must be an active internet connection to fetch the data, otherwise the progress bar will keep spinning in the middle unless you exit and enter the program again :)

# Used libraries

Retrofit is used to fetch and parse JSON data from a server, which I believe is the most frequently used in almost all applications.

Recyclerview is used (Android Jetpack version) to display data more efficiently.

Material design libraries are used to create designs that follows the latest guidelines.
